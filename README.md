# World_Weather_Analysis

## Overview

This assignment consists of three technical analyses:

Deliverable 1: Retrieve Weather Data
Deliverable 2: Create a Customer Travel Destinations Map
Deliverable 3: Create a Travel Itinerary Map

## Deliverable 1 - 

Generated a set of 2,000 random latitudes and longitudes, retrieved the nearest city, and performed an API call with the OpenWeatherMap to retrieve the current weather description for each city. Subsequently, a new DataFrame was created containing the updated weather data and exported into a csv file to hold the information. 

## Deliverable 2 - 

Based on input statements to retrieve customer weather preferences, potential travel destinations and nearby hotels were identified and put into a dataframe. The destinations were shown on a marker layer map with pop-up markers.

## Deliverable 3 -

Used the Google Directions API to create a travel itinerary that shows the route between four cities chosen from the customerâ€™s possible travel destinations. Subsequently, created a marker layer map with a pop-up marker for each city on the itinerary.
